      <h1>WNYC Hybrid Architecture</h1>
      <p class="subtitle">Results and Recommendations</p>
      <section>
        <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
        <p>
          The goal of this project is to deliver a <em>next generation
          listener experience</em>
          for <a href="www.wnyc.org">www.wnyc.org</a> without the
          up-front cost, delay, and risk of a complete rewrite.  We
          can achieve that goal by deploying a new hybrid architecture
          that combines a modern, in-browser Ember application
          with your existing Django application.
        </p>

        <p>
          In this two week project I built a fully-working prototype
          Ember app that can play persistent audio, render existing
          content from Django, and seamlessly combine new dynamic
          components with existing server-rendered content. The app
          demonstrates general techniques for introducing new features
          while gradually refactoring older features in a
          pay-as-you-go process.
        </p>

        <p>
          Taking this prototype into production will require
          substantial QA testing, since it touches almost every aspect
          of the user-facing website. It will also require deployment
          planning and design. However, no major pieces of software
          remain to be created &mdash; the architecture is essentially
          complete, and it should be possible to steadily iterate with
          the new and old architectures running side-by-side until you
          gain sufficient confidence to begin switching users over.
        </p>

      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>The Hybrid Architecture</h2>

        <p>
          The key to understanding this new architecture is to think
          of your site as two applications, not one. This is a
          significant shift from how a traditional website
          works.
          <label for="like-mobile" class="margin-toggle
          sidenote-number"></label> <input type="checkbox"
          id="like-mobile"
          class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">It's actually
          much closer to how native mobile apps work, and keeping that
          analogy in mind can help when you're designing your build,
          test, and deployment process.</span>
        </p>

        <p>
          The frontend application, written in Ember, manages all
          navigation and rendering. It communicates with the backend
          application (your existing Django app, nearly unchanged)
          when it needs to fetch or store information. By minimizing
          the coupling between the two applications, we make it easier
          to develop and test each one, sticking to the strengths of
          each respective framework's conventions.
        </p>

        <p>
          The architecture is "hybrid" because the data passed from
          backend to frontend is not strictly semantic. It is often
          pre-rendered into HTML, CSS, and even Javascript. This is
          what allows us to achieve a graceful upgrade &mdash; we can
          let the server continue to render the things it's already
          rendering well, while mixing in dynamic client-rendered
          content as desired.
        </p>

      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Ember Application Tour</h2>

        <p>
          This section highlights several important pieces of your
          Ember application that make the hybrid architecture
          possible. The application is in the <code>wnyc-web-client</code>
          subdirectory on the branch <code>efaulkner/prototype</code>
          in the
          repo <code>git.wnyc.net:puppysite</code>. <label for="separate-repo"
          class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>
          <input type="checkbox" id="separate-repo"
          class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">I would
          recommend switching to separate repos for frontend and
          backend applications. It clarifies their division of
          responsibilities.</span>
        </p>

        <h3>Routing</h3>

        <p>
          Routes are defined using standard Ember conventions,
          in <code>app/router.js</code>. We have a catch-all route
          named <code>djangorendered</code> that can handle any URL
          and render it by fetching the corresponding page from the
          server. But more specific routes can also be defined, and
          the <code>story</code> route serves as good example.
        </p>

        <p>
          The important feature here is that you can choose to
          gradually specialize individual URLs when you want to
          deliver new dynamic features, while leaving all other URLs
          up to the catch-all route.
        </p>

        <h3>Fetching Content from Django</h3>

        <p>
          There is an <code>ember-data</code> model
          named <code>django-page</code>, with corresponding adapter
          and serializer implementations. The adapter & serializer
          abstract the details of page fetching<label for="fetch-api"
          class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>
          <input type="checkbox" id="fetch-api"
          class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">I use
          the <a href="https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/">Fetch API</a>
          throughout, which is a modern replacement
          for <code>XMLHttpRequest</code>. The <a href="https://github.com/stefanpenner/ember-fetch">ember-fetch</a>
          addon provides a polyfill that works on all browsers
          that Ember supports.</span> so the rest of the Ember
          application can use standard conventions for fetching and
          caching data.
        </p>

        <p>
          Requests from the Ember app include a
          custom <code>X-WNYC-Ember</code> HTTP header that can be
          used within Django to tailor responses that are more
          appropriate for consumption by the Ember app. Search
          for <code>HTTP_X_WNYC_EMBER</code> in the Django templates
          to see where I am using this technique.
        </p>

        <p>
          The <code>django-page</code> model has
          an <code>appendTo</code> method that puts the page's content
          into the DOM, while dealing gracefully with styles and
          scripts. It depends on the <code>script-loader</code>
          service (described further below) to simulate the way any
          scripts would have executed during a normal page load.
        </p>

        <h3>Rendering Django Content</h3>

        <p>
          Once you have a <code>django-page</code> model, you can
          render it with the <code>django-page</code> component. The
          component has three important features.
        </p>

        <p>
          First, it knows how to render the page model into the
          DOM. Second, it intercepts clicks on links in the content
          and converts them into Ember transitions. This is a critical
          step to enable persistence &mdash; we don't want a link to
          take the user back to the server.
        </p>

        <p>
          And third, it can gracefully embed dynamic Ember
          content <em>inside</em> the Djangorendered content. Here's
          an excerpt from the <code>story</code> template:
          </p>

          <pre class="code"><code class="language-handlebars">{{#django-page page=model.page}}
  {{#if model.story.commentsEnabled }}
    {{#ember-wormhole to="comments" }}
      {{story-comments story=model.story
                       user=model.user
                       getComments=model.getComments
                       browserId=model.browserId.identity }}
    {{/ember-wormhole}}
  {{/if}}
{{/django-page}}</code></pre>

        <p>
          The above means "render the given Django page, then if
          comments are enabled, render the <code>story-comments</code>
          component inside the element
          with <code class="language-javascript">id="comments"</code>". This
          is the key technique for gradually enhancing your existing
          pages with new dynamic capability.
        </p>


        <h3>Script Loader Service</h3>

        <p>
          The <code>script-loader</code> service solves one particular
          problem: during the initial rendering of a web
          page, <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tags execute synchronously
          in order of appearance. But at any later point, newly
          created <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tags run in
          unpredictable order. Much of your legacy Javascript assumes
          strict ordering. So the script loader manually retrieves and
          executes scripts in exactly the same order they would have
          run during initial page load.
        </p>

        <p>
          Another browser feature that only works at initial load
          is <code>document.write</code><label for="document-write"
          class="margin-toggle
          sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox"
          id="document-write"
          class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote"><code>document.write</code>
          is considered legacy technology with quirky behavior, and
          new code should not use it.</span>. To keep your existing
          scripts working, I added an <code>async-writer</code>
          service that replaces <code>document.write</code> for
          scripts that are running after page load.
        </p>

        <p>
          <code>script-loader</code> and <code>async-writer</code>
          work together to ensure that even scripts added
          via <code>document.write</code> execute in the correct
          order. But sometimes the legacy code is quirky enough that
          we don't actually want to run it at all, or we need to
          deliberately change ordering, which brings us to
          the <code>legacy-loader</code>.
        </p>

        <h3>Legacy Loader and Compatibility Hooks</h3>

        <p>
          The <code>legacy-loader</code> service
          and <code>app/lib/compat-hooks</code> exist to make the
          refactoring of legacy Javascript more manageable. When a
          problem is uncovered, it can often be fixed quickly by
          adding a new rule to one of these, and later when the
          offending code gets refactored the rule can be removed.
        </p>

        <p>
          Your Django app uses Django Compressor to manage most
          Javascript assets. I added a new Javascript
          precompiler<label for="document-write" class="margin-toggle
          sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox"
          id="document-write"
          class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Django
          Compressor only applies Javascript precompilers
          to <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tags with the correct
          mime-type. You should make a pass through your templates to
          fix up any that are still missing. It's not fatal, but any
          scripts that don't go through the precompiler won't be
          subject to the legacy loader's rules.</span> to your
          Compressor configuration
          called <code>ModuleWrapper</code>. It adds a tiny module
          loader interface to each Javascript file.
          The <code>legacy-loader</code> service is able to use that
          interface to control the execution of individual Javascript
          files, even after they have been concatenated and minified.
          See the comments
          in <code>app/services/legacy-loader.js</code> for more
          detail on how it can be used to suppress or reorder
          evaluation of individual scripts.
        </p>

        <p>
          There is an optional <code>LOG_LEGACY_LOADER</code> flag
          in <code>config/environment.js</code> that can enable
          verbose browser console logging of which scripts are
          running. The log is very helpful in identifying where an
          exception is coming from, but it's also very noisy when
          you're working on something else.
        </p>

        <h2>Next Steps</h2>

        <h3>Integrate the Listings App</h3>

        <p>
          Prior to this work, you had two Ember apps embedded in the
          site: wnyc-web-client-story and wnyc-web-client-listings. I absorbed
          wnyc-web-client-story into the new Ember app in order to
          demonstrate how it should work. You will need to do the same
          with the listings app.<label for="emapp-refactor"
          class="margin-toggle
          sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox"
          id="emapp-refactor"
          class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">In the process
          of porting wnyc-web-client-story, I refactored its data flow to
          bring it closer to Ember standard conventions and reduce the
          API surface area between it and your legacy Javascript. It
          would be helpful to review these changes and try to emulate
          them as you go forward.</span>
        </p>

        <h3>Review my addition to CMS content model</h3>

        <p>
          I added<label for="cms-model" class="margin-toggle
          sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox"
          id="cms-model"
          class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">See commit
          0992ac8ceb0.</span> the ability to
          embed <a href="http://jsonapi.org/">JSONAPI</a>-compliant
          structured data in your Django templates. You will want to
          review this change and make sure it fits into your model
          hierarchy. In particular, I'm not confident that my example
          code deals correctly with the distinction between "cms" and
          "npr" namespaced models, and the difference may interfere
          with generating valid security info when submitting comments
          on NPR stories.
        </p>

        <h3>Update build and deployment code</h3>

        <p>
          I recommend dropping the build code
          in <code>grunt/wnyc-web-client.js</code>. Use stock ember-cli to
          build the Ember app.

          Use <a href="http://ember-cli.github.io/ember-cli-deploy/">ember-cli-deploy</a>
          to deliver the Ember app to Django and your CDN / media
          servers.
        </p>

        <h3>Progressive Boot</h3>

        <p>
          I don't think Ember Fastboot is a requirement for deploying
          this new architecture. It could be a nice simplification
          down the road, but since we already have server-generated
          content available, we can just continue using that.
        </p>

        <p>
          Instead, we can extend the Ember app so that during the
          first render it detects the content already in the page and
          skips the fetch and django-page render, taking over from
          there for subsequent navigation.
        </p>

        <h3>Test Interactive Elements</h3>

        <p>
          This is probably the biggest remaining task. All pages with
          existing Javascript-powered interactions need to be reviewed
          to ensure that those interactions are still working. Most of
          them are working, but you will definitely find some that
          need small tweaks (like a new rule in the legacy-loader
          service or in the compat-hooks).
        </p>

        <p>
          One example of a Javascript element that is not fully
          working is ad_leaderboard.js. It needs to be updated to work
          when loaded asynchronously.
        </p>

        <h3>Review Analytics and Advertising Functionality</h3>

        <p>
          There are several disparate pieces of analytics Javascript
          that should probably just be moved directly into the Ember
          app, where they will have a stable home and complete
          visibility into user actions. But at a minimum, those
          analytics should be reviewd to ensure they're still working.
        </p>

        <p>
          GPT-driven advertising is working, although I had to disable
          synchronous rendering mode (it's not clear why that was
          enabled originally). Like analytics, you will probably want
          to move global initialization and configuration of
          advertising code into the Ember app, so that it runs once
          per session (instead of once per navigation) and maintains
          persistent visibility. Confirm that page-context-based
          targeting rules are being updated correctly as users
          navigate within the Ember app.
        </p>

        <h3>Replace my placeholder loading screen</h3>
        <p>
          I added a spinning WNYC logo to demonstrate how loading
          templates work. You will want to design something nicer.
        </p>

      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Strategic Recommendation</h2>
        <p>
          A successful outcome for this project requires both a
          working website and a team that is happily and creatively
          pushing forward, confident in their shared understanding of
          the platform and the vision.
        </p>

        <p>
          For that reason I would recommend against outsourcing the
          bulk of the remaining work because it's important to
          cultivate expertise and ownership within your team. I would
          be happy to stay involved in an advisor / mentor role to
          ensure that the project keeps moving forward. In particular,
          I think periodic code reviews can be extremely valuable, and
          some on-demand pair-programming is a great way to cut
          through tricky bugs quickly while also serving as great
          learning opportunities.
